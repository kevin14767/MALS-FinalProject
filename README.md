# MALS-FinalProject
This repository contains all the files to a website I plan to create for my Mexican American Studies class.
The purpose of the website is to explore the mythohistory and origin depcited in the chapter "Entering into the Serpent" by Gloria Anzaldua's work "Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza".
