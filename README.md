# MALS-FinalProject
This repository contains all the files to a website I plan to create for my Mexican American Studies class.
I plan to have a foucs on archival knowledge on indigenous. Furthermore If I can connect it to a Queer focus then that would be ideal.
For now, this is a work in progress!
