                    <h1>Indigeneity in the Archive</h1>
                    <p>Incorporating indigeneity into the archive, as seen in Gloria Anzaldúa’s work, "Borderlands/La
                        Frontera,” raises questions on how indigeneity is portrayed, the origin of it in the archive,
                        and how this archive will look like going forward.
                        Before Anzaldúa’s sad passing, she proposed the concept of “new
                        tribalism,” understood as a “social identity that could motivate subordinated communities to
                        work together in coalition” (Castellanos et al. 9). However, she’s aware of the complications of
                        this concept, reflecting that “tengo miedo que, in pushing for mestizaje and a new tribalism, I
                        will ‘detribalize’ them. Yet I also feel it’s imperative we participate in this dialogue, no
                        matter how risky” (Castellanos et al. 12). </p>
                    <p2>I bring this concept forward to highlight the complexity of incorporating indigeneity into the
                        archive. Moreso, I want to further indulge in the complications surrounding this archive and
                        contextualize the indigeneity that Anzaldua archives in Borderlands/La Frontera. Specifically,
                        focusing on the chapter titled "Entering Into the Serpent".
                        This is the goal of my archive. To create new understandings based off the limited
                        archival documents of Mesoamerican indigeneity, which can be visualized in many
                        different methodologies.</p2>
                    <h2>Entering into the Serpent</h2>
                    <h3>From GradeSaver</h3>
                    <p2>
                        In Chapter 3, “Entering Into the Serpent,” Anzaldúa writes a history of patriarchy within
                        Indigenous and Mexican culture and spiritual practice. After this personal story,
                        Anzaldúa shifts to discuss the history of Mexican spirituality, and the changing role of female
                        deities over time. Noting the influence of Indigenous religious practice on contemporary Chicano
                        Christianity, Anzaldúa focuses on the figure of la Virgen de Guadalupe, largely seen as a
                        Catholic image of the Virgin Mary. Anzaldúa argues that la Virgen is really an instantiation of
                        the Indigenous deity Coatlalopeuh. Coatlalopeuh is herself only one aspect of the earlier
                        goddess Coatlicue, or “Serpent Skirt,” possessed of both light and dark aspects (27). In order
                        to disempower this female figure, “the male-dominated Azteca-Mexica culture” got rid of those
                        more powerful and complicated aspects, representing them with male gods instead while redefining
                        Coatlicue as Tonantsi, her nurturing and motherly guise (27).

                    <p>Coatlalopeuh, the Mexican indigenous name for the Virgin of Guadalupe, is an indigenous goddess,
                        descended from the earlier versions of Earth and fertility goddesses of the indigenous peoples
                        of
                        Mexico.</p>
                    <h2><a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/4942482" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of Coatlalopeuh</a></h2>
                    <p1>In the Mexican indigenous belief system, one of the earlier deities that Coatlalopeuh descended
                        from
                        was the goddess Coatlicue (meaning "Skirt of Snakes") who was considered the creator. When the
                        patriarchal Aztec-Mexica culture dominated the region, it transformed the feminine goddesses
                        into
                        sinister monsters and replaced their roles with masculine gods. Coatlicue became a snake god.
                        Separating itself from the darker goddesses, the goddess Tonantzin eventually emerged as the
                        creator. It is believed that Tonantsi planted the cactus in Mexico and created pulque.

                        After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, the Roman Catholic Church tried to discourage the
                        indigenous
                        people from using their goddesses, by relating them to prostitutes and keeping the other
                        Catholic
                        saints as virgins. In order to survive the Catholic cultural domination, the goddess Tonantzin
                        had
                        to be separated from its indigenous characteristics and thus Guadalupe was born. To be accepted
                        by
                        the Church, Guadalupe needed to be rid of the sexuality and serpent-related attributes of its
                        ancestor, Coatlalopeuh.</p1>
                    <h2>Gloria Anzaldua's use of Coatlalopeuh</h2>
                    <p1>Coatlalopeuh is descended from, or is an aspect of, earlier
                        Mesoamerican fertility and Earth goddesses. The earliest is Coatlicue, or "Serpent Skirt." She
                        had a
                        human skull or serpent for a
                        head, a necklace of human hearts,. a skirt of twisted serpents and
                        taloned feet. As creator goddess, she was mother .of the celestial
                        deities, and of Huitzilopochtli and his sister, Coyolxauhqui. Another aspect of Coatlicue is
                        Tonantsi. The
                        Totonacs, tired of the Aztec human sacrifices to the male god.,
                        Huitzilopochtli, renewed their reverence for Tonantsi who preferred the sacrifice of birds and
                        small
                        animals (Anzaldua pg.27).</p1>

                    <p id="nahua">Tonantzin is a revered figure in Aztec and Mexican mythology. The name "Tonantzin"
                        translates to "Our Revered Mother" or "Our Mother" in Nahuatl, the Aztec language. She is often
                        associated with fertility, motherhood, and the earth.</p>
                    <h2> <a
                            href="https://www.theyucatantimes.com/2021/12/tonantzin-the-deity-behind-our-lady-of-guadalupe/">The
                            Story Behind Tonantzin</a>
                    </h2>
                    <p>The narrative of the "Nican Mopohua," which means "Here is narrated," is the oldest manuscript in
                        which the Virgin of Guadalupe's appearance to the Aztec indigenous Juan Diego is told in the
                        Nahuatl language. There are three versions of the manuscript in the Public Library of New York,
                        but so far is still being determined which is the original.
                    </p>
                    <p2>In Aztec mythology, Tonantzin was considered to be a mother goddess, associated with nurturing
                        and fertility. She was often depicted as a motherly figure, caring for the people and providing
                        them with sustenance. Her representation encompassed the nurturing aspects of life, symbolizing
                        both the earth's fertility and maternal care.

                        After the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 16th century, there was a blending of indigenous
                        beliefs with Catholicism. The Spanish conquerors sought to convert the indigenous people to
                        Christianity. To ease the conversion process, they often incorporated elements of indigenous
                        beliefs into Christian practices. This approach aimed to replace indigenous deities with
                        Christian figures.

                        In this context, the image of Tonantzin became associated with the Virgin Mary, particularly
                        with the apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe. According to tradition, in 1531, an indigenous
                        man named Juan Diego claimed to have seen an apparition of the Virgin Mary on the hill of
                        Tepeyac near Mexico City. She spoke to him in Nahuatl and identified herself as "Holy Mary,
                        Mother of God."

                        The Virgin of Guadalupe became a significant symbol for both indigenous Mexicans and Spanish
                        conquerors. The location of her appearance was believed to be the same site where the Aztecs had
                        previously worshipped Tonantzin. The Spanish used this connection to help convert the indigenous
                        population to Catholicism by associating the Virgin Mary with Tonantzin, allowing for the
                        preservation of certain indigenous beliefs under a Christian veneer.

                        Over time, Tonantzin became intertwined with the figure of the Virgin of Guadalupe, leading to a
                        cultural and religious fusion that continues to hold significance in Mexican and
                        Mexican-American cultures. Many people still honor Tonantzin as a representation of the earth,
                        motherhood, and indigenous spirituality, sometimes within the context of the Virgin of
                        Guadalupe's veneration.</p2>

                    <h1 id="Coatlicue">Coatlicue</h1>
                    <p>In Aztec mythology, Coatlicue is a major deity associated with creation, fertility, and life and
                        death cycles. The name "Coatlicue" is derived from Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, and it
                        can be translated to "Serpent Skirt" or "Serpent Her Skirt." Coatlicue holds a significant place
                        in the pantheon of Aztec gods and goddesses.
                    </p>
                    <p2>
                        According to Aztec mythology, Coatlicue is often depicted as a fearsome and powerful goddess.
                        She is portrayed with a skirt made of intertwining snakes and a necklace of human hearts, hands,
                        and skulls. Her appearance is both life-giving and destructive, symbolizing the dual nature of
                        existence.
                    </p2>
                    One of the most well-known myths involving Coatlicue is the story of the miraculous birth of the
                    god Huitzilopochtli. According to the myth, Coatlicue found a ball of feathers on the slopes of
                    the Coatepec mountain and tucked it into her clothing. This action miraculously impregnated her
                    with the god Huitzilopochtli, who would later become the patron deity of the Mexica people.
                    <p3>
                        The mythology surrounding Coatlicue reflects the Aztec understanding of the interconnectedness
                        of life, death, and rebirth. Coatlicue is often associated with fertility, the agricultural
                        cycle, and the cycles of life and death. She represents the transformative forces of creation
                        and destruction in the natural world.
                    </p3>
                    <p4>
                        It's important to note that Aztec mythology is complex and multifaceted, and interpretations of
                        deities like Coatlicue can vary. The stories and beliefs surrounding Coatlicue were a crucial
                        part of the religious and cultural worldview of the Aztec civilization.
